packaging by layer:-controllers,services,repositoirires/dao's,models/POJO or data classes

example:User,movie,ticket

controller:
/UserController
/movieController
/ticketController

service
/userservice
/movieservice


packaging by feature(for very large codebase):keep all classes related to an entity/feature together
example:user,movie,ticket

user
/usercontroller
/userservice
/userrepository
/user

movie
/moviecontroller
/movieservice
/movierepoistory
/movie

so in lld classes we will follow packaging by layer
